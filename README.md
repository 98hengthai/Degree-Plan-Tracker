# Degree-Plan-Tracker
A website that allows Computer Science students to keep track of their degree plan. 

Three-section of the application:
1. Database Server
The database is created on the school server. 
The raw data was researched as part of the project. The guidance was provided throughout the development by an academic advisor.
Imported raw data (excel file) using SQuirreL SQL Client software. Minor modifications are needed in the process.

2. Web Server - Database Handler
The project was developed using Eclipse IDEA.
Utilized JDBC to create a connection to the database and further performs the execution of database commands.
Included a testing class for all executed functions.

3. Web Server - Web Interface Handler (APIs)
Created a Dynamic Web Project and imported Apache Tomcat webserver to Runtime Environment.
Used JSP and HTML to create dynamically generated web pages that interacted with the database handler.
